# Hyperlink-Induced-Topic-Search-over-Wikipedia-articles
This system generates a subset of graphs using Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) over currently available Wikipedia articles.  HITS is a link analysis algorithm designed to find the key pages for specific web communities.It is also known as hubs and authorities. HITS relies on two values associated with each page: one is called its hub score and the other its authority score. For any query, the system computes two ranked lists of results. The ranking of one list is induced by the hub scores and that of the other by the authority scores.  This approach stems from a particular insight into the very early creation of web pages --- that there are two primary kinds of web pages that are useful as results for broad-topic searches. For example, consider an information query such as “I wish to learn about the eclipse”. There are authoritative sources of information on the topic; in this case, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)’s page on eclipse would be such a page. We will call such pages as authorities. In contrast, there are pages containing lists of links (hand-compiled) to authoritative web pages on a particular topic. These hub pages are not in themselves authoritative sources of topic but they provide aggregated information. We use these hub pages to discover the authority pages.
